# Example app using vue, vuex, and typescript

This example is based on the images tutorial in Stephen Grider's [VueJS Essentials](https://www.udemy.com/vue-js-course) course.

I created the project with vue cli 3.0.0-rc.3

It uses the [vuex-type-helper](https://github.com/ktsn/vuex-type-helper) package, which is similar to what will hopefully be merged into vuex soon, [as mentioned here](https://github.com/ktsn/vuex-type-helper/issues/2#issuecomment-371833868) and [discussed here](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/pull/1121).
